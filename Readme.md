Meson Cross Files
==================

This repository contains auto-generated Meson Cross-compilation definition files.

They can be used directly or used as reference and forked for custom modifications.


## cross_definitions.py

The CrossDefinitions class provides a pseudo-inheritance scheme to easily generate multiple definition files.

Just use the `based_on()` method to declare inheritance on base definitions.
